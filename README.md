# assessment.local
Assessment info for Palmetto state armory

 I have everything configured but had to change a few things. Some reason Redhat only allowed me to license 2 servers out of the 3 I have installed but I believe the outcome would have been the same, except I would have added another backend server as backend server2 in default.vcl for Varnish. I used 192.168.1.0/24 because thats what my router was already set too and it was easier to test, I did however keep the hostnames and last octets the same for this project. assessment.local was set to 192.168.1.10 and had nginx running with a self signed certificate I set up for ssl offloading on port 443 which directed traffic to 80 via Varnish on the backend servers. I ran into a strange issue and had to look up some things online to get the ssl offloading working properly after the ssl offloading was pulling up a 504 error. I then looked at the nginx logs in /var/log to see a permission denied error when trying to redirect to port 80 via 127.0.0.1:80 I set up in the assesment.local virtual host file. I found it wasnt OS permissions or firewalld because I allowed http and https services via the firewall, then after coming across this page https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23948527/13-permission-denied-while-connecting-to-upstreamnginx and found it was permission denied errors being caused by selinux, which I applied a fix and now ssl offloading is directing traffic to the backend servers(server) from port 443 through nginx on .10(assesment.local) to 80 via Varnish on the backend servers(server) I am still working on remembering how to manage uploading the configs and everything here on github, so I hope this comes out OK overall.
